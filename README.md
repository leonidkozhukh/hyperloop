**implementation has a software-centric core:**

- [accounting.md](https://github.com/leonidkozhukh/hyperloop/blob/master/accounting.md)

- communication

		- internal status and obstacle navigation
		- internal (& external?) resource sharing to minimize footprint
		- external open source collaboration
		- external content marketing

- full digital model of hyperloop ecosystem

		- topology + tunneling
		- pillars on topology
		- tube + solar on pillars
		- hyperloop stations
		- pods in tube + propulsion system


*modeling can be parallelized:*

- topology with satellite data + google self-driving car data

- main construction (pillars, tube, solar)

- internal system (propulsion, capsultes, safety)

*each part maps to physical actions as next steps:*

- set concrete route, figure out land use

- test main construction on small scale

- test internal system on small scale
